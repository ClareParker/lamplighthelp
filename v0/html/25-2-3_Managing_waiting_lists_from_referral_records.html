<h1>25.2.3    Managing {{waiting list}}s from {{referral}} records</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>{{People}} can be added to {{waiting list}}s from a {{referral}} record </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To add a {{person}} to a {{waiting list}} when creating a {{referral}} record, go to {{work}} on the main menu -> add -> {{referral}} as usual.</p>

<p>Complete the steps as shown in section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/10.1.0">10.1.0  Adding a {{referral}} record</a>. There is however an additional option on the {{referral}} record to complete due to the {{waiting list}} module. On the <strong>Details</strong> tab, there is a dropdown option enabling the {{user}} being referred to be added to a {{waiting list}}.</p>

<p>Select the appropriate {{waiting list}} from the drop-down box. When all the details within the {{referral}} record have been completed and the <strong>save</strong> button has been clicked, the {{user}} will have been added automatically to the chosen {{waiting list}}. The date they joined the {{waiting list}} will be the date of the {{referral}}, NOT the date the record is entered into {{Lamplight}}. Please note the {{user}}s must be marked on the <strong>Attendance</strong> tab as 'attending' and as 'service user referred' to be added to the {{waiting list}}.</p>
