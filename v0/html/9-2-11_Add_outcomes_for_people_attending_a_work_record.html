</blockquote>

<p>To add {{outcome}}s for everyone attending a {{work}} record, click 'add {{outcome}}s' on the context menu. This will open a popup window allowing you to enter {{outcome}}s for everyone attending the {{work}} record. Note that everyone will have the same {{outcome}} if you enter them in this way - a good way to enter outcomes such as standard baseline information, or completion of a training course. </p>
