<h1>19.5.0    Use {{group}}s to enter a lot of {{people}} at once</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The search-as-you-type boxes also search {{group}}s, and if it finds one and you click on it, will enter everyone in that {{group}} at once. So if you are finding yourself entering the same {{people}} over and over, create a {{group}} and use that. </p>
