<h1>12.6.3    {{Comm}}s - setting up a CampaignMonitor campaign</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>A 'campaign' is the email content, linked to a maling list. You can set up your campaign in {{Lamplight}} via {{work}} -> {{comm}} -> create CampaignMonitor campaign </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you start a new CampaignMonitor campaign, you'll see the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}238a.png" alt="Creating a new CampaignMonitor campaign" /></p>

<p>Give the campaign a name - this will need to be unique for CampaignMonitor, the subject line for the email, complete the other details, and choose the {{group}} you want to send the campaign to. The {{group}}s listed here are the ones that you've previously synchronised with CampaignMonitor (see <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/12.6.2">12.6.2  {{Comm}}s - creating a CampaignMonitor mailing list from {{Lamplight}}</a>). Click 'next'</p>

<p>Enter your email message content as usual (see <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/12.1.5">12.1.5  {{Comm}}s - adding {{message}} content</a> for help using the text editor). You will notice that the mail merge fields are missing: CampaignMonitor doesn't support some of the mail- merge features that {{Lamplight}} does. However you can use document templates (see <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/4.4.2">4.4.2  Mail merge, templates and images</a>). Below the main text of the message you can also add css rules. Again this is linked to the way that CampaignMonitor works; but if you want to add additional styling to the message you can use this to do so. When you are ready click 'create campaign'. This will not send any emails yet.</p>

<p>If there were any problems creating the campaign you will receive an error message: please take note of this and contact {{Lamplight}}. But if is successful, you will see a screen similar to this one:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}238b.png" alt="After creating a campaign" /></p>

<p>You can do some checks before the campaign is sent out. Firstly, to see how the email will look as a web preview, click the 'View it online here' link. We'd suggest that before sending it out, you send a preview to yourself; select this option and enter your email address in the 'Who to send the preview to' field, and click 'save'. This will tell CampaignMonitor to send you a preview of the email so that you can check it all looks OK. </p>

<p>At this stage, again due to limitations in the way that CampaignMonitor accepts instructions from {{Lamplight}}, you will have to log in to CampaignMonitor directly to make any changes required to the campaign. If so you can also send it directly from there too. Alternatively, to send from {{Lamplight}}, go to {{work}} -> view -> CampaignMonitor campaigns on the main menu, find your campaign, and open the context menu. From here you can send another preview, or send the campaign to all recipients:</p>

<p>Once the campaign is underway you can see brief statistics (number of emails opened; number of clicks, number of 'unsubscribes', number of 'bounces' (ie email addresses not recognised), number of emails uniquely opened). By logging into the CampaignMonitor site you can see more detailed statistics if required. You may want to read more about these statistics from CampaignMonitor: [understanding email open rates](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/entry/1694/understanding- email-open-rates/), for example, gives some explanation of what it means; what the limitations are; and what 'usual' open rates might be. </p>
