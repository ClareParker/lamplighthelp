<h1>24.6.0    {{Project}} sharing</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default no information is shared between different {{project}}s. {{Project}} sharing allows you to do so if necessary. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will need to contact {{Lamplight}} to enable {{project}} sharing if you do require it, and obviously only applies if you have more than one {{project}}</p>

<p>{{Project}} sharing lets you control in very fine detail what information is shared between different {{project}}s. You can share profile information and {{work}}, {{outcome}}, {{referral}}, {{eval}} and {{comm}} records. This sharing is controlled by <strong>policies</strong> that determine which {{project}}s the information should be shared with, what information to share, and whether information can be editted. Your system administrator will need to set up policies for profile sharing and {{work}} etc. record sharing. For more information on setting up policies see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/24.6.1">24.6.1  {{Project}} sharing - setting up policies</a>. Once these policies are in place, you need to apply the policy to particular records - by default no information is shared until you explicitly choose to do so.</p>

<p>These policies specify:</p>

<ol>
<li>Which {{project}}s to share with</li>
<li>The access level needed for other database operators to be able to view the shared record</li>
<li>How much of the record to share (for example, just name but not contact details</li>
<li>Whether operators in other {{project}}s may add to or edit the record, or just view it</li>
</ol>

<p>For more information on sharing profiles, see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/24.6.2">24.6.2  {{Project}} sharing - sharing profiles</a>. For more on sharing {{work}} etc. records see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/24.6.3">24.6.3  {{Project}} sharing - sharing {{work}} etc. records</a>. </p>
