<h1>17.3.2    {{Outcome}} {{report}}s - data produced when looking at 'count yes responses'</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Counting number of yes responses' does just that - it doesn't look for change, just the number of 'yes' {{outcome}}s achieved. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In {{outcome}}s {{report}}s, you can select 'Count number of yes responses' in the 'How to summarise the data', and you will see a table similar to this:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}134a.png" alt="{{Outcome}}s {{report}}ing - count yes results" /></p>

<p>The columns in this table show:</p>

<ul>
<li>{{Outcome}} - the name of the particular {{outcome}}</li>
<li>Number of 'yes' responses - a count of the total number of 'yes' values entered. One person with three 'yes' {{outcome}} scores will be counted as 3 in this column.</li>
<li>Number of 'no' responses - a count of the total number of 'no' values entered. One person with three 'no' {{outcome}} scores will be counted as 3 in this column.</li>
<li>Number of different {{people}} with 'yes' response - a count of 'yes' responses but avoiding 'double-counting' - so one {{person}} with multiple 'yes' responses will only be counted once.</li>
<li>Number of different {{people}} with 'no' response - as above but for 'no' responses - that is, there is a 'no' recorded, not that they have 'no response'. Note though that one {{person}} with both a 'no' and a 'yes' response will be counted in this and the previous columns.</li>
<li>Number of different {{people}} with any response - the total number of {{people}} who have any response at all. </li>
</ul>
