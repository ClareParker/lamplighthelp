<h1>18.9.0    {{Comm}}s module image library</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The image library stores images you may wish to use repeatedly (such as logos) in {{comm}}s. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Current items in the library are displayed in a series of panels. The images displayed here are thumbnails; the original image is stored in the system and the originals are what are used in {{comm}}s. These are the images that will appear on the drop-down menu in the text editor when creating {{comm}}s.</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}157a.png" alt="Library images" /></p>

<p>To add an image, click 'Add library item'. A popup window will appear: give the image a meaningful name, and select the image on your computer that you wish to upload and use. Click the 'save' button to add it to the library.</p>

<p>To remove an image from the library, click the small red 'x'. </p>
