<h1>17.2.0    {{Work}} {{report}}</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>{{Work}} {{report}}s give a summary of the amount of {{work}} you have done. Although there are various options, the simplest way to think of the {{report}}s is as counting ticks on registers. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>{{Work}} {{report}}s provide a number of options of how to present and analyse your data, in the '{{Report}} Presentation' tab:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}131a.png" alt="{{Work}} {{report}} - presentation" /></p>

<p>The display format enables you to change the way in which your data is presented: you may select as many of these as needed.</p>

<p>The row data and column data select boxes enable you to segment your data by the characteristics of those attending. The options in the drop-down boxes are the select-box fields in user profiles (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.7.0">8.7.0  Other information tabs</a>). Note that if you select something in the 'Column data' drop-down you will not get a pie chart.</p>

<p>The 'Data to show' options allow you to count your data in different ways. </p>
