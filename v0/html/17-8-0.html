<h1>17.8.0    {{Referral}} {{report}}</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>{{Referral}} {{report}}s provide a summary of the {{referral}}s that have occurred within any time frame. You may also want to look at view -> {{referral}}s on the main menu, which provides quite a lot of detailed information. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>{{Referral}} {{report}}s collate information captured within {{referral}} records, and information collected about those involved in the {{referral}}s can be used to add additional {{report}} presentation options. </p>

<p>To run a {{referral}} {{report}}, on the main menu click on {{report}}s -> more -> {{referral}} {{report}} </p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}185a.png" alt="{{Referral}} {{report}} results" /></p>

<p>The {{referral}} success and direction can be used as filters for this {{report}}. The options within them may vary as your system administrator is able to customise the lists to reflect how you need to capture your {{referral}} data. </p>

<p>The display format enables you to change the way in which your data is presented: you may select as many of these as needed. </p>

<p>The row data and column data select boxes enable you to segment your data by the characteristics of those attending. The options in the drop-down boxes are the select-box fields in user profiles (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.7.0">8.7.0  Other information tabs</a> ). Note that if you select something in the 'Column data' drop-down you will not get a pie chart. </p>

<p>The 'Data to show' options allow you to count your data in different ways. </p>
