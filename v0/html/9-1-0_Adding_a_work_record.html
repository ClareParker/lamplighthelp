<p>It is possible to customise the system to add extra fields and tabs, so your system may differ to the example here. See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.4.0">18.4.0  Custom {{work}} and other record tabs and fields</a> for more information about customising {{work}} records.</p>

<p>The record is split up into three tabs: when and where it happened (<a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.1.1">9.1.1  When and where</a>); who was there (<a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.1.2">9.1.2  Adding attendance details to a {{work}} record</a>); and the details of what happened (<a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.1.4">9.1.4  Completing the 'details' tab in a {{work}} record</a>).</p>

<p>When you have added all information, click the 'save' button in the bottom right. </p>
