<h1>23.4.0    Communicating with invitees of {{eval}} direct campaigns</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>{{Lamplight}} lets you email invitees to {{eval}} direct campaigns: all of them, those that haven't responded, or those that have. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To email invitees, view all campaigns (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/23.2.0">23.2.0  Viewing existing {{Eval}}s Direct campaigns</a>), right-click (or use the menu button) on the campaign you wish to view, and select the appropriate email option. There is no difference between these except that the recipient list is filtered appropriately. For more details on {{comm}}s generally see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/12.0.0">12.0.0  {{Comm}}s</a>.</p>

<p>The key difference is that the text editor features additional mail-merge options that you can use. To view these, click on the '{{Message}} content' section and then open the text editor: </p>

<p>The {{Eval}} Campaign toolbar button has mail-merge fields for each recipient's URL, and also the title, start date and end dates for the campaign. Using these options you can send personalised emails to each recipient, inviting them to complete the {{eval}} and giving them a link in the email that will take them straight to it.</p>

<p>If you have the {{Comm}}s module, you may want to create one or more Document templates that include these merge fields, saving you even more time. When you have finished writing your email, click the 'create/send' button. Emails will be sent (to all those with email addresses) to each recipient. You will need to make alternative arrangements for anyone without an email address (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/23.3.0">23.3.0  Viewing, edit and delete details of a particular {{Eval}}s Direct campaign</a> to download URLs). </p>

<p>Please also note that if you are using the campaign merge fields (for example 'campaign_url') the invitee list of the campaign must match the recipient list for the email, for the merge fields to correctly sync. </p>
