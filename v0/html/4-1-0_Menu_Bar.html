<h1>4.1.0    Menu Bar</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The menu is the main way that you will navigate around the system. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The menu bar along the top of the screen is where you will navigate around the system. </p>

<p>The first line of menu items (starting with 'Home') can be clicked; clicking displays the menu for that section. If you hover the mouse over any heading a dropdown sub-menu may appear. Simply click on the sub-menu item to go to the page you need.</p>

<p>Some menus have sub-menus: you can tell because there are small black arrows pointing to the right.</p>

<p>Clicking on the menu headings themselves will take you to the first item on the menu. So, if you click on <strong>{{People}}</strong> it will take you to the view all {{user}}s page.</p>

<p>Throughout this manual you will see 'go to {{work}} -> view all on the main menu'. The arrow indicates the {{work}} sub- menu. </p>
