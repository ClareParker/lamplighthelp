<h1>12.1.3    {{Comm}}s - setting email details</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enter additional information required for your emails, and the way they are sent. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are sending emails, you will need to complete the additional email fields.</p>

<p>You can give the email a subject title in the text box and ensure the correct email address is being used to send the email from. By default this will be the email address you use to log in to {{Lamplight}} with. This will be the email address the recipients will see as the sender and if they click to reply to the email, it will where their reply is sent to. Please note that emails are sent through {{Lamplight}} and therefore a copy of the email won't be in the sent items of your separate email system (for example outlook). </p>

<p>Within this section you can also choose whether to send multiple, individual emails, or a single one cc or bcc-ed to everyone. If you are sending to a large number of recipients, and particularly if there are attachments, we strongly recommend that you send a single email. {{Lamplight}} is not designed as a mass- marketing tool, and large volumes of large emails create problems with our mail delivery servers. </p>
