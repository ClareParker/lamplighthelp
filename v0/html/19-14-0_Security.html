<p>We've made a lot of changes to increase the security of the new version of {{Lamplight}}. First of all, you'll notice a 'Digicert' logo on the login page. We use 256-bit SSL encryption to prevent eavesdropping of the information travelling between your computer and our server. The server itself is in a physically secure location.</p>

<p>Other standard good practice we follow includes (in brief):</p>

<ul>
<li>all forms are hashed to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks (CSRF)</li>
<li>all data input is filtered and validated

<ul>
<li>all data is escaped when displayed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>all database transactions use parameters and quoting</li>
<li>application code is outside of the web directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also use a number of techniques to secure the server itself. </p>
