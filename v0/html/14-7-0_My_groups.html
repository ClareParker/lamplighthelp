<h1>14.7.0    My {{group}}s</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>{{Group}}s you have created, or edited most recently, will be tagged as belonging to you. These provide a short-cut in the main menu: on {{Group}}s-> My {{group}}s-> and you will see a list of these {{group}}s. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clicking on the name of the {{group}} will show you the simple list of members. </p>

<p>If you just click on {{Group}}s -> My {{group}}s on the main menu you will see the list of your {{group}}s in a table, similar to section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.4.0">14.4.0  Viewing {{group}}s</a> . </p>
