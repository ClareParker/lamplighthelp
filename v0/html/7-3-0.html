<h1>7.3.0    My {{Message}}s</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your {{message}}s - messages, reminders, to-do's - are like your post-it notes - but with dates attached and linked to other information in {{Lamplight}}. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Set yourself reminders or {{message}}s that will show not only in the table found under the My {{Message}}s tab, but will also be highlighted on the diary so that no appointment or action needs to be missed. </p>

<p>Within the My {{Message}}s tab, add a new row to create a new {{message}} and work along the row, clicking inside each box to enter in information.</p>

<p>The {{message}} created will be shown in the diary with a distinctive red line on the left hand side.</p>

<p>Tasks can also be linked to and created from {{work}}, {{outcome}}, {{referral}}, {{grant}} and {{eval}} records. They appear in a separate tab on the {{work}} etc. record.</p>

<p>Please note for these to appear within records, your system administrator will need to customise the global settings accordingly. </p>
