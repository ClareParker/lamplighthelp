<h1>18.8.1    Adding a {{comm}} template</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>To add a {{comm}} template, right-click on the table or use the menu button and select 'Add new'. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A popup window will appear.</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}154a.png" alt="Adding a new template" /></p>

<p>Enter the name of the template (this is what will appear on the drop-down menus), and then set up the template using the rich text editor.</p>

<p>Templates can include normal text, formatted as you wish. They can also include images from the image library (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.9.0">18.9.0  {{Comm}}s module image library</a> ) And you can also add mail merge fields (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/4.4.2">4.4.2  Mail merge, templates and images</a> ).</p>

<p>In addition, templates can also include other templates. So, for example, you could create a 'letterhead' template. You could then create a standard 'reminder letter' template that would include the 'letterhead' template at the start. This means that you only need to set up the letterhead once, and you can then re-use it in other templates as much as you want.</p>

<p>Be careful not to create circular references in your templates. If one template includes a second, then make sure the second template doesn't in turn use the first! If {{Lamplight}} finds circular references it will stop processing them and the results may not be as you expected.</p>

<p>When you have finished, click the 'save' button in the bottom right hand corner. This template will now be available when creating other templates and when creating {{comm}}s.</p>

<p>Templates are available to all {{project}}s. </p>
