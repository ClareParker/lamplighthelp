<h1>14.0.0    Introduction to {{group}}s</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>A {{group}} is a collection of {{people}}. You can create different types of group: automatic, manual or merge. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A {{group}} is a collection of {{people}}. You can set up any number of {{group}}s, and each {{person}} can belong to lots of {{group}}s. For example, you may set up the following {{group}}s:</p>

<ul>
<li>steering {{group}} members</li>
<li>{{user}}s in N1</li>
<li>new {{user}}s in Q2 and Q3 2011</li>
<li>all youth {{work}} {{staff}}</li>
<li>organisations working with children</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use {{group}}s in different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>bulk data entry. Perhaps you have a regular {{group}} of {{user}}s that come to every session. Instead of adding them individually each time, create a {{group}}, and enter the name of the {{group}} in your {{work}} record. {{Lamplight}} will add everyone that's in the {{group}} to the {{work}} record (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.1.2">9.1.2  Adding attendance details to a {{work}} record</a> ). You can do the same for {{outcome}}s and {{comm}}s.</li>
<li>{{Report}} filters. Rather than running {{report}}s for everyone on the system, {{group}}s can be used to limit the data included in the {{report}} (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.1.1">17.1.1  {{Report}} filters</a> ).</li>
<li>{{Group}} data views. You can use {{group}}s to view various pieces of information about different {{people}} at once (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.0">14.8.0  {{Group}} data views</a> ).</li>
</ul>

<p>There are three types of {{group}}s: {{manual group}}s, {{auto group}}s, and {{merge group}}s. {{Manual group}}s are created by selecting names from a list. {{Auto group}}s are like saved searches: you enter the criteria (e.g. 'postcode starts with N1') and {{Lamplight}} searches for everyone that meets those criteria. Each time you use the {{group}}, {{Lamplight}} will automatically check again: so if someone moves out of the area and you update the postcode, that person will no longer be in the {{group}}, without you having to change anything else. {{Merge group}}s are composed of existing {{auto group}}s or {{manual group}}s - {{Lamplight}} will take all the members of each of the {{group}}s you specify and combine them into one, removing any duplicates. </p>
