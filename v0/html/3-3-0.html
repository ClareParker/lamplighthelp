<blockquote>
  <p>{{Lamplight}} stores details of the {{work}} you do (services you provide) as {{work}} records. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>{{Lamplight}} holds details of the {{work}} you do with your {{user}}s. These are called {{work}} records in {{Lamplight}}. Each {{work}} record stores information about:</p>

<ul>
<li>when and where it happened;</li>
<li>what happened; and</li>
<li>who was there.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each {{work}} record is categorised by '{{workarea}}'. {{Workarea}}s in {{Lamplight}} are a way of categorising the different things that you do, to make it easier to sort, search and report on your {{work}} later. Each {{workarea}} can have {{subworkarea}}s below it.</p>

<p>See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.0.0">9.0.0  {{Work}} records</a> for more about {{work}} records, and section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.1">18.2.1  System Administration - {{Workarea}}s</a> or more information about setting up {{workarea}}s. </p>
