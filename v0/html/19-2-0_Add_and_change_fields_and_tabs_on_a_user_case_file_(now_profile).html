<h1>19.2.0    Add and change fields and tabs on a user case file (now profile)</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Previously, you were unable to add fields or tabs to user profiles (which used to be called {{linked case}} files). We had to do it for you. The new version allows you to add tabs and fields of different sorts through the admin menu (see <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.3.0">18.3.0  System Administration - Custom profile tabs and fields for {{people}}</a>). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can add, edit, or delete tabs and fields on profiles: the new version allows you to do this through the admin menu (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.3.0">18.3.0  System Administration - Custom profile tabs and fields for {{people}}</a> for details). </p>

<p>Additionally, any fields you add will be available in automatic groups. And 'select' type fields will also be available in {{report}}s to cross-tabulate your {{report}} data. </p>
