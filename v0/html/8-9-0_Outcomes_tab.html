<h1>8.9.0    {{Outcome}}s tab</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The {{outcome}}s tab shows the change you've seen over time </p>
</blockquote>

<p>{{Outcome}}s information for the individual or organisation are displayed on this tab. They can also be added here.</p>

<p>{{Outcome}}s can be displayed as a radar diagram, in a 'data-entry' table, and in a simple table view. The radar chart shows and lets you add new data by clicking on the chart; the 'data-entry' table shows {{outcome}}s down the side and months along the top, and lets you add new measures in bulk. </p>

<p>This shows the {{outcome}}s information for this {{person}} only. The radar diagram shows an {{outcome}} on each axis. The position and colour of the line shows the score and date it was achieved. For example, the diagram above shows the results in July (brown, inner line); September (blue line) and October (green line). Exercise for this person has gone from a '1' in July (meaning they don't do much) to a '5' in October (meaning they are doing lots). In general (assuming larger numbers are 'better') you will hope that the shapes get gradually bigger as time goes on.</p>

<p>The 'data-entry' table lists all the {{outcome}}s down the right, and then months along the top. You can click a single cell, or existing score, to add or edit an {{outcome}}. The right-most column lets you add several {{outcome}}s at once; enter the scores, and then at the bottom of the table set the date and {{workarea}} and click to save.</p>

<p>The table view shows the date of the {{outcome}}, a summary of the result, and the {{linked case}}s it is attached to are displayed in the table.</p>

<p>The order in which the records are displayed can be changed by clicking on the column headings. The default setting for viewing outcomes is 5 to a page but more or less can be viewed at once by choosing an option from the select box. Alternatively you can use the numbers to move through the records.</p>

<p>To add new outcomes click on the Add button on the right hand side of the screen.</p>

<p>Right clicking on a row of the {{outcome}} table will give you a range of options:</p>
