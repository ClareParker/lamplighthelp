<h1>16.2.0    Contract Details Tab</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contract detail information is used by the timesheet system in its calculations. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The information entered into this tab forms the basis for the calculations that are used for the timesheet and the annual leave summary.</p>

<p>To enter information click on the Add button, found on the right hand side within the Contract details tab of a {{staff}} members profile. A form will open up and details can be entered. Click Save on the right hand side when complete.</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}121a.png" alt="{{Staff}} contract details tab" /></p>

<p>{{Staff}} may only have one contract open at any time, so if you add a new contract record an existing one that's still open will be 'closed' - the date to will be set automatically. </p>
