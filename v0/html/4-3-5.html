<p>A new tab or window will open in your browser and you will be prompted to open or save the file (this can vary based on your browser and browser settings). The download will be created with the data as it is shown currently in the table.</p>

<p>At the foot of each table, there is also the option to 'Print table'. Once selected a new print-friendly version of the table will open in a new tab on your browser. </p>
