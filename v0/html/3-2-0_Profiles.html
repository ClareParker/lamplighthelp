<h1>3.2.0    Profiles</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every {{person}} in {{Lamplight}} has their own profile. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every individual and every organisation has a profile. This holds all the information that relates to that {{person}}. To see the profile for a particular {{person}}, start typing their name in the search box on the top right hand corner of your screen, when they appear on the drop-down list, click their name.</p>

<p>Your system administrator can add tabs that you see, and the information on them. These can vary depending on whether you are looking at a profile for a {{user}}, member of {{staff}} etc, or whether they are an individual, a family, or an organisation. They can also vary for different {{project}}s (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.3.0">18.3.0  System Administration - Custom profile tabs and fields for {{people}}</a> for information about setting up tabs and fields, and section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/3.7.0">3.7.0  {{Project}}s</a> for more about {{project}}s). </p>
