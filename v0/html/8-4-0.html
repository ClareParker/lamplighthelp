<h1>8.4.0    Adding a profile</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>To add a new profile for a {{person}}, click '{{people}} -> add new' on the main menu. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To add a new profile move your mouse up to the menu bar to the {{People}} option and select Add from the sub menu that appears.</p>

<p>You will then see a page on which to add the basic information about that individual or organisation.</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}45b.png" alt="Adding a new {{person}}" /></p>

<p>All profiles, whether they are for {{user}}s, {{staff}}, {{funder}}s, {{org}}s or {{contact}}s start from the same initial input page. However, they must be either a person or an organisation (you may also have 'family' as an option): select which using the 'Type' options.</p>

<p>If you are entering a {{person}} you will see input boxes for title, first name, surname and suffix. (Titles and Suffixes will be available if your system administrator has added them in the system administration section). If you are entering an organisation you will see an input box for the organisation name.</p>

<p>Once you have entered the name of the {{person}}, select what kind of profile you are creating - see <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/3.1.0">3.1.0  {{People}}</a> for more information about these roles. </p>

<p>Save the profile by clicking the save button at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.</p>

<p>You will now see the profile page for the {{person}} you have just entered (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.3.0">8.3.0  Profiles</a> ). </p>

<p>Along from their name is a series of buttons; print, del and edit</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}45c.png" alt="The newly added profile" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Print: will open up a new tab in your web browser with their profile information for you to choose which tabs of information you wish to print.</li>
<li>Delete: will delete their profile from view, and archive it so it will not appear in day to day use (but can be retrieved if needed).</li>
<li>Edit: will open up a form so that you can edit the name and type of profile. </li>
</ul>
