<h1>24.6.2    {{Project}} sharing - sharing profiles</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Profile information can be shared with other {{project}}s when you add them, or through the {{project}} sharing tab in their profile. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have {{project}} sharing enabled, then when adding a new profile you will see an additional drop-down box: 'Select {{project}} sharing policy'. You will have to select something from this drop-down, but the second option is always 'No sharing'. Other policies set up by your system administrator will appear below this: please check directly with them if you are unsure about which to use.</p>

<p>When you view a profile, you will see a {{project}} sharing tab, which will look different depending on whether the profile has been shared. If it is not currently being shared, it will look similar to this one:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}234a.png" alt="profile {{project}} sharing tab - no sharing" /></p>

<p>To start sharing this profile, select the appropriate policy from the drop-down list and click 'save'.</p>

<p>If a profile is being shared, it will look more like this:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}234b.png" alt="profile {{project}} sharing tab - sharing" /></p>

<p>This explains the effect of the sharing policy - who and what is being shared. To stop sharing this profile, tick the 'revoke project sharing' checkbox and click 'save'. Other {{project}}s will now have no access to this profile. </p>
