<h1>11.1.2    Adding {{outcome}}s - attendance</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enter details of who the {{outcome}}(s) involve. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The attendance tab records details of everyone for whom this {{outcome}} applies. Mostly this is likely to be a single {{person}}. However, there may be times when you need to enter these in bulk, for example if a group of {{people}} have achieved a training qualification that you wish to record. </p>

<p>You can also record outcomes for members of {{staff}} or others on the system.</p>

<p>To add additional {{people}}, start typing their name in the box. When you have typed three letters, a drop-down menu will appear showing all matches: select the name you are looking for. They will be added to the table.</p>

<p>You can also add members of a {{group}} in bulk: start typing the name of the {{group}} in the search box and you will see matching {{group}}s too. If you click on a {{group}} the system will add everyone in the {{group}} to the table.</p>

<p>To alter the role for a particular {{person}}, click on the table cell and a drop-down box will appear. Select the appropriate option. Your system administrator can add options to these lists (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.0">18.2.0  System Administration - Lists</a> ).</p>

<p>To remove someone added in error, click the delete box - the right-hand table cell of the row you wish to delete. This will check and then remove them from the table. </p>
