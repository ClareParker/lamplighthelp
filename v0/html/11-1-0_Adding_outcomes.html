<p>To add an {{outcome}} record, go to {{Work}}->Add->{{Outcome}}s on the main menu. You will see the main screen for entering {{outcome}} records:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}74a.png" alt="Adding an {{outcome}} record" /></p>

<p>The first two tabs, 'When and where' and 'attendance' are standard (see <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/11.1.1">11.1.1  Adding {{outcome}}s - when and where</a> and <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/11.1.2">11.1.2  Adding {{outcome}}s - attendance</a>): the remaining tabs are the names of the {{outcome}} categories you (or your system administrator) have set up. It is also possible to customise the system to add extra fields and tabs, so your system may differ to the example here. See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.4.0">18.4.0  Custom {{work}} and other record tabs and fields</a> for more information about customising {{outcome}} records.</p>

<p>When you have added all information in all the tabs, click the 'save' button in the bottom right. </p>
