<h1>11.2.0    Viewing all {{outcome}} records</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>To view all {{outcome}} records, click '{{work}} -> view all -> {{outcome}}s' on the main menu </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To view a list of all {{outcome}} records, click on '{{Work}} -> View -> {{Outcome}}s' on the main menu. You will see the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}79a.png" alt="List of all {{outcome}}s recorded" /></p>

<p>This lists all {{outcome}} records occurring in the last month, ordered by date with the most recent showing at the top.</p>

<p>To restrict the listing to particular dates or {{workarea}}s, click the '-' icon on the right of the search bar, and search options will appear. Change the details and click the 'fetch data' button and the table will reload.</p>

<p>The context menu for the table has a number of options: right-click on a row of the table to see these. Some will be disabled, depending on the {{outcome}} record.</p>

<p>The options on this context menu are very similar to those for {{work}} records: see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.2.0">9.2.0  Viewing all {{work}} records</a> for more information. </p>
