<h1>4.5.0    Buttons</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Buttons do more than click - some have menus too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many screens have buttons that do particular things: usually adding or editing information, or saving it. Just click the button, normally located on the bottom right hand side. </p>

<p>Some buttons, mainly for selecting {{workarea}}s, do more. When you select something from one of these buttons, you will see the text on the button change to whatever it is you've just selected.</p>

<p>You can often also make multiple selections on these buttons. With {{workarea}}s, select a {{subworkarea}} and you will see the {{workarea}} and {{subworkarea}} on the button. You can now select another {{subworkarea}} (from the same {{workarea}}) and it will be added again:</p>
