</blockquote>

<p>The charging module allows you to set charges for attending a {{work}} record, and then decide who should pay that charge. There is a great deal of flexibility in the way that charges are calculated, and the payments due split between different {{people}}. Once these payments have been allocated, they can be batched up into invoices and can then be exported into your own accounting software for billing and credit control purposes. </p>

<p>The charging module is designed so that it's really quick and easy to use on a day to day basis. This does mean that setting it up is more involved. </p>

<p>For day-to-day use, when adding a {{work}} record you will see a {{charge}} tab, which lets you choose a charging policy and a payee policy for the record. </p>

<p>Charging policies determine how much each {{person}} attending should be charged; Payee policies determine who should pay this charge. </p>

<p>Both charge and payee policies can take various factors into account in their calculations. You create these policies to do what you need them to do. </p>

<p>For example, you might have a charging policy that charges everyone Â£50, and a payee policy that says that the {{person}} attending pays the full amount. A more complex example of a charging policy would: </p>

<ol>
<li>Use an hourly rate for the {{workarea}} chosen, a fixed amount for the location used, and the hourly rate for the staff present,

<ol>
<li>If {{people}} attending are unemployed, charge them a fixed rate of Â£10,</li>
<li>Gives a discount for {{people}} booking online before a certain date</li>
<li>Only charges {{user}}s attending the full amount; staff are charged nothing and {{people}} that do not attend are charged 50%</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>A more complicated payee policy might say: </p>

<ol>
<li>If the {{person}} attending lives in Westminster, charge Westminster Council 50% (we have a contract with them)</li>
<li>If the {{person}} attending has a visual impairment we can charge Â£30 to a private Foundation that has given us a grant.</li>
<li>Charge any remainder to the {{organisation}} linked to the person that attended</li>
</ol>

<p>When you create a {{work}} record using these policies, {{Lamplight}} will calculate the amounts and payees, and they will appear on the {{charge}} tab of the relevant profiles, with a summary shown on the {{work}} record. </p>

<p>By using these policies it is possible that the amount charged for someone attending a {{work}} record will not be the same as what they pay: indeed often the {{person}} attending will not pay anything. In these cases, the 'charge' should be thought of as the total amount paid by all parties (i.e. funders) for that person attending. </p>

<p>These policies are set up by the system administrator. </p>
