<h1>17.7.0    {{Staff}} timesheet {{report}}</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>{{Staff}} timesheet {{report}}s provide a summary and breakdown of how {{staff}} time is spent, captured through the {{Staff}} Management Module </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Information is taken from each {{staff}} timesheet, which in turn is taken from the {{work}} records they've attended, plus contract details, non-contact work, appraisal, training and absences records. </p>

<p>To run a {{staff}} timesheet {{report}}, on the main menu go to {{report}}s -> more -> {{staff}} timesheet {{report}} </p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}184a.png" alt="{{Staff}} timesheet {{report}} results" /></p>

<p>The {{report}} presentation tab allows you to select how you wish to view the {{report}} data. Once the selection has been made, click 'run {{report}}' in the bottom right hand corner. </p>

<p>If you wish to show timesheets combined across all {{project}}s, the system administrator can, via the admin menu, make this alteration. Go to admin -> system administration -> change global settings -> {{staff}} module. </p>
