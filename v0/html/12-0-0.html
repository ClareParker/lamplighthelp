<h1>12.0.0    {{Comm}}s</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The {{Lamplight}} {{comm}}s module lets you create, store, log, and {{report}} on the {{comm}}s you've created. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A '{{Comm}}' created within {{Lamplight}} is a letter, email, mailing labels or text message (sms). These can include mail merge features. Some features are included in the core module; more advanced features are only available with the {{Comm}}s module.</p>

<p>You can create {{comm}}s (for example an email-merge), or if you have the {{comm}}s module you can also log that a {{comm}} has happened (e.g. a phone call). </p>
