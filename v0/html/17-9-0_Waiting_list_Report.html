<h1>17.9.0    {{Waiting list}} {{Report}}</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>{{Waiting list}} {{report}}s show you the number of {{people}} on your {{waiting list}}s over time, and the length of time they have been on them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The {{waiting list}} {{report}} provides a number of ways to analyse the numbers and size of your {{waiting list}}s. As with other {{Lamplight}} {{report}}s, there are several tabs that let you define how your data should be filtered and presented.</p>

<p>On the first tab, select the date ranges as normal, and a {{group}} if needed. You can also restrict the {{report}} to particular {{waiting list}}s if needed, too.</p>

<p>If available, the {{project}}s tab will aggregate data across several {{project}}s (see <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.1.2">17.1.2  {{Report}}s across several {{project}}s</a>).</p>

<p>The final tab, report presentation provides options on the way data is shown, the way dates are handled, and allows you to {{report}} based on the information in particular fields on profiles.</p>

<p>The 'How to summarise the data' has three options: the default is <strong>show overall statistics for the period.</strong> This gives the following data for each {{waiting list}}:</p>

<ol>
<li>Number of {{people}} at the start of the period: on the first day in the range specified, how many {{people}} were on the {{waiting list}}?</li>
<li>Number joining the {{waiting list}} in the period: how many have been added between the two dates?</li>
<li>Number leaving the {{waiting list}} in the period</li>
<li>Total number of different {{people}} - one {{person}} may be on the same {{waiting list}} more than once in the date range, but they will only be counted once each in this column. This may mean that this figure is different to the previous columns</li>
<li>The mean time spent on {{waiting list}} gives a 'calendar time' waiting time, averaged over everyone on the {{waiting list}}. The 'date to' specified in the Report filters section of the {{report}} will be used as the 'date left' for any {{people}} still on the {{waiting list}} on the 'date to'. This may mean that the figure changes, depending on the 'date to' that you set.</li>
<li>The mean time spent on {{waiting list}} (weekdays) is a similar calculation but excludes weekends (but not bank holidays etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>This report gives you a sense of turnover, in the first four columns, and total waiting times, in the final two.</p>

<p>To see how this changes over time, you can change the 'how to summarise the data' to <strong>'weekly showing average size of {{waiting list}}'</strong> or <strong>'monthly showing average size of {{waiting list}}'</strong>. These two do the same thing, but over different time spans. When you run the {{report}} using either of these, you'll see a table listing the different {{waiting list}}s down the side, and the dates (weeks or months) along the top. Each figure in the table is the number of {{people}} on the waiting list each week (or month). Below that is a graph showing the same data. {{Lamplight}} calculates these figures by checking how many {{people}} were on the {{waiting list}} each day, and then averaging this over the number of days in the week (i.e. 7) or month (which varies). Between two dates, then, this {{report}} shows you how demand for your services has varied week-by-week or month-by-month. </p>
