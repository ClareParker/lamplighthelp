<h1>11.0.0    {{Outcome}}s - overview</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>{{Outcome}}s enable you to measure the impact you have on your {{user}}s. You measure how each {{person}} is doing at different times, and as time goes by you can see the changes that have occurred. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Choosing the {{outcome}}s you wish to measure, and the way that you are going to measure them, is not always straightforward. Section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.2">18.2.2  {{Outcome}}s</a> has more information about how to set up your {{outcome}}s, and you may want to look at existing ways of doing this if you haven't already got an outcome framework in place. There are a number of resources that can help you with this: see the External Resources section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/20.6.0">20.6.0  External Resources</a> for more some links.</p>

<p>{{Outcome}} {{report}}ing in {{Lamplight}} looks primarily at <strong>change</strong> therefore you need to record at least a baseline position and a final position. For example, you may be interested in helping people into work, and have an {{outcome}} item of 'Do they have a job?'. If your project is successful, it will have helped people who don't have a job to find one; and those that do have a job will retain them. To know if this has happened, you will need to ask people whether they have a job when they first start using your services, and again later on. </p>

<p>Collecting this type of data can be very powerful. It is possible to then {{report}} on the amount of change {{user}}s experience overall; but also to look at how quickly change occurs, and how this varies between different groups of {{people}}. It is also possible to look at the relationship between the amount of {{work}} you have done, and the impact is has had.</p>

<p>{{Lamplight}} lets you collect this kind of data for your {{user}}s, whether they are people, families or organisations. But if you want to you could also use outcomes with {{staff}} to track their development, for example, or with partner agencies to see if you have any impact on their practices.</p>

<p>In some cases it will not be possible or appropriate to collect this data in this way. For example, you may run a one-off training session and ask participants to complete an evaluation form at the end of the session. In this case there is no baseline position, and you will need to be able to {{report}} '78% of participants felt that the training was valuable'. You may then compare this with previous years: <strong>but the participants are (most likely) different people.</strong> This is a different type of data, which in {{Lamplight}} uses the {{Eval}} module: see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/15.0.0">15.0.0  {{Eval}}s module overview</a> for more details. </p>
