<p>In a profile you will see a charge tab: this lists all charges allocated to that {{person}}. </p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}257a.png" alt="Viewing charges for a {{person}}" /></p>

<p>These are the amounts that the payee policies used have determined this {{person}} should pay; they are not the total charges incurred from their attendance at a {{work}} record. In other words, these are the amounts that the {{person}} should be (or has been) invoiced. </p>

<p>If you do want to see the details, use the right-click menu and select 'view calculations'. This will show you the total amount that was charged, and who else is paying towards it. You can also view the {{work}} record, and the invoice (if it has been batched into an invoice (see below or section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.6.2">26.6.2  Creating invoices in bulk</a>)). </p>

<p>To batch up any outstanding charges into an invoice, for export into your accounting software (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.7.1">26.7.1  Transferring data to Sage</a> or <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.7.2">26.7.2  Transferring data to QuickBooks</a>), select the rows using the tickboxes and click the 'batch for invoicing' button. This will open a form to set additional invoice information. </p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}257b.png" alt="Creating invoices from profiles" /></p>

<p>When you click 'save' this will create invoice details as specified, and prepare an export file that you can use to import into your accounting software (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.7.1">26.7.1  Transferring data to Sage</a> or <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.7.2">26.7.2  Transferring data to QuickBooks</a>). {{Lamplight}} does not create printable invoices itself; it is better to do this within your existing accountancy software, rather than duplicating functionality. </p>

<p>Below the table there is space to tell {{Lamplight}} the unique ID value that this {{person}} has in your accountancy software, so that invoices can be allocated correctly. Just add this in and click 'save' on the right hand side to update this. If this is set, the .csv export file will include this ID value. </p>

<p>You can also batch up invoices in bulk - to lots of different {{people}}, through the admin section - see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.6.2">26.6.2  Creating invoices in bulk</a> for help on how to do this. </p>
