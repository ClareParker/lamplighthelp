<h1>4.3.2    Splitting data up: table pagination</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>A paginator splits the data in a table into smaller chunks to make it easier to handle. The paginator control lets you move through the 'pages' of your data. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is a lot of information to see, the paginator splits it into chunks to make it easier to deal with. The paginator looks like this and appears at the top of tables:</p>

<p>All the data is split up into 'pages' - click the page number you wish to view to jump forwards or back.</p>

<p>You can also alter the number of rows displayed on each 'page': Change the drop-down value as required. </p>
