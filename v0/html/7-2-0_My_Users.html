<h1>7.2.0    My {{User}}s</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>My {{user}}s are the {{user}}s you {{work}} with often </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There will often be {{user}}s, {{contact}}s or {{funder}}s that you {{work}} with regularly. Rather than search for them every time or browse through long lists, you can set them up to appear on this tab shown on your homepage. It will allow you to have easy access to their contact details and profiles. </p>

<p>The relationship between you and your {{user}}, {{contact}} or {{funder}} will need to be set within one of the profiles via the <strong>Relationship tab.</strong> See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.6.0">8.6.0  Relationships tab</a> for more information on how to do this. </p>

<p>If the My {{User}}s tab doesn't appear on your homepage, you may need to enable it via the <strong>'Change my personal settings'</strong> section, see <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.12.0">18.12.0  My personal settings - customising {{Lamplight}}</a>.</p>

<p>Once the tab is visible and a link has been created, you can use the tab, almost like your own personal address book, specific for your work. To view their profiles right click with your mouse on the {{person}} you'd like to see and this will give you a range of options:</p>

<ul>
<li>View case file - opens the user profile</li>
<li>Edit - allows you to edit the relationship between you and the {{person}}</li>
<li>Delete - Deletes this {{user}}, {{contact}} or {{funder}} from your list - but doesn't delete them from the system</li>
<li>Communicate - it will open the new {{comm}} page where you can send an email, text or write a letter.
<img src="{{imgpath}}38a.png" alt="my {{user}}s" /> </li>
</ul>
