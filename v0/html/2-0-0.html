<h1>2.0.0    Introduction</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>An overview of {{Lamplight}} and the contents of the help system </p>
</blockquote>

<p>{{Lamplight}} is a fully featured management system for charities and voluntary sector organisations. </p>

<p>This manual starts by explaining the <strong>general concepts and language</strong> we use in the system, and how to <strong>navigate</strong> around the system and use some of the common controls (sections <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/3.0.0">3.0.0  General concepts</a> and <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/4.0.0">4.0.0  Navigation and controls</a>). There are also some answers to Frequently Asked Questions (<strong>FAQs</strong>) in section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/5.0.0">5.0.0  Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>

<p>Sections <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/6.0.0">6.0.0  Logging In</a> and <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/7.0.0">7.0.0  Homepage</a> <strong>get you started</strong> - how to log in and what's on the home page. The subsequent chapters explain how to <strong>add, edit and view records</strong> in the system. In some areas you will see reference to 'Modules': these are optional additions to {{Lamplight}} that provide extra features if they are needed. If you do not have these modules enabled these sections will be slightly greyed out and with a message and the information will not apply to your system. Please contact us if you would like to turn these features on on your system.</p>

<p>The <strong>{{report}}</strong>s available in {{Lamplight}} are covered in section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.0.0">17.0.0  {{Report}}s</a>, which provides details of how to generate different {{report}}s, and some help on what they might mean.</p>

<p>The final sections cover <strong>system administration</strong>, changes from previous versions, troubleshooting, and some pointers to help when setting up your system for the first time.</p>

<p>Each section starts with a brief summary or 'how-to'; you may only need to read the summary for a quick reminder. Each section then has detailed text and in many cases screenshots that explains in detail how to accomplish a particular task or use a feature of Lamplight.</p>

<p>The manual is available as a download, or online through the 'help' option on the main menu.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions about how the documentation could be improved do please let us know, by email to <a href="mailto:enquiries@lamplightdb.co.uk">enquiries@lamplightdb.co.uk</a> </p>
