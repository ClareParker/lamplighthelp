<h1>22.4.0    Cost data {{report}}</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cost data {{report}}s can be run to allow analysis of the cost involved in running activities, sessions or different interventions </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These cost data {{report}}s connected to {{work}} completed are run via a {{work}} {{report}}.</p>

<p>On the {{report}}s section on the menu bar, click {{work}} -> {{report}}. To produce a cost data {{report}}, the 'data to show' option on the {{report}} presentation tab must have 'Cost data' ticked.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that where you can split the data once with row data, any criteria you may have specified in the column data option will be ignored in the finally produced {{report}}.</p>

<p>The {{report}} will generate the following statistics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mean cost per user attending - this is a 'cost per head' metric. This is calculated by taking the total cost for all {{work}} records included in the {{report}}, and dividing by the number of {{user}}s attending (i.e. Attendance type is 'attended' and Role is {{user}}).</li>
<li>Mean cost per session - calculated by dividing the total costs incurred by the total number of {{work}} records included in the report.</li>
<li>Total costs - the sum of the costs incurred.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to run a cost data {{report}} for a particular session or time frame for example, please use the {{report}} filters tab to be selective on the {{work}} you wish to run the cost data on. Please see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.1.1">17.1.1  {{Report}} filters</a> on {{report}} filters for more information on this and section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.2.0">17.2.0  {{Work}} {{report}}</a> for more information on {{work}} {{report}}s. You can also see the costs for a particular {{work}} by viewing that record. </p>
