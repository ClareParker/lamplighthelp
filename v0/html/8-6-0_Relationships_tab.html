<h1>8.6.0    Relationships tab</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Relationships link different {{people}} in {{Lamplight}}. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new {{person}} may have any number of relationships to other {{people}} on the database. These are added to the profile in the relationships tab. </p>

<p>For example, you may wish to record which people work with a new {{user}} regularly, who their doctor is, their key worker, social worker, parole officer and other members of the family on the database. You can record as many relationship as you like here.</p>

<p>To add a new relationship, click add on the right hand side of the screen.</p>

<p>A small pop up window will appear. Begin typing the name of the {{person}} to whom your {{person}} is related in the search box. The live search will display the names of the {{people}} on the database who match the name you are typing. Select the name of the {{person}} from the list that appears.</p>

<p>Below the search box, select the relationship in which they stand to the new user or organisation (e.g. trustee, employer, key worker, my {{user}} - for more information about My {{User}}s see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/7.2.0">7.2.0  My {{User}}s</a>).</p>

<p>The final option is to select whether you wish this {{person}} to be the default contact for the {{person}}s profile you are currently in. This may be appropriate if you wish to write to an organisation, but address and send it to the manager's personal email account.</p>

<p>Once the relationship has been established the table in the tab will be updated. You can then use the context menu from the table for further actions.</p>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
<li>move into the linked {{person}}s profile by clicking 'view full details'</li>
<li>Edit or delete the relationship link (if you have the appropriate access level)</li>
<li>move directly into a {{comm}} record to communicate with linked {{person}} (not with the {{person}} whose profile you are in)</li>
<li>copy address details from the linked {{person}} - useful if they live/work at the same address, it will copy it automatically and update the contact details tab immediately.
