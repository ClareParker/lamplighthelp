<h1>17.1.2    {{Report}}s across several {{project}}s</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The {{project}}s tab lets you run {{report}}s for several {{project}}s combined. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have access to more than one {{project}} (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/3.7.0">3.7.0  {{Project}}s</a> ) you will also see a '{{Project}}s' tab:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}128a.png" alt="{{Project}} {{report}}ing tab" /></p>

<p>Simply tick the boxes for the {{project}}s you wish to {{report}} on, and {{Lamplight}} will aggregate all {{project}}s into a single {{report}}.</p>

<p>Note that if you use {{group}} or {{workarea}} filters in the previous tab (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.1.1">17.1.1  {{Report}} filters</a> ) you need to be sure that these groups or {{workarea}}s are shared across all {{project}}s. </p>
