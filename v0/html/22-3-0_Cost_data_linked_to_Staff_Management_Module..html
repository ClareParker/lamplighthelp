<h1>22.3.0    Cost data linked to {{Staff}} Management Module.</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Costing Module can be linked to the {{Staff}} Management Module to allow the {{staff}} cost connected to a {{work}} record to be calculated. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within the {{staff}} management module, hourly wages for different members of staff can be entered into the contract details tab within their profile. This information is then used when a {{work}} record is created so that the total staff cost involved in running the piece of {{work}} is calculated.</p>

<p>The calculation will be automatic, provided that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the {{staff}} members hourly wage has been entered into their profile, and that the contract period covers the date of the {{work}} record.</li>
<li>The {{staff}} member has been added to the attendance list</li>
<li>the {{staff}} members attendance type is 'Attended' and their role is 'staff'</li>
</ul>

<p>The {{staff}} hierarchy works in connection with authorisation levels with expenses. It means that you are only able to authorise/pay expenses for people that you manage. Your system administrator will have organised the hierarchy that exists within your system. Please speak with them if you are uncertain about this. </p>
