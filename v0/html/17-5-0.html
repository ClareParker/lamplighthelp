<h1>17.5.0    {{Eval}} {{report}}</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The {{eval}} {{report}} presents summaries of {{eval}} questionnaires completed. The {{report}} shows each question, with the number (or percentage) of responses for each option. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the '{{Report}} filters' tab there is an additional option, 'Select {{eval}}', listing the {{eval}}s available. You will need to select the relevant {{eval}} from this list.</p>

<p>The {{report}} will produce a series of tables, one for each question in the {{eval}}.</p>

<p>If {{eval}}s have been entered as linked to a particular {{person}}, it is possible to split data by background factors of those {{people}}, using the 'Column data' drop- down.</p>

<p>Once you have run the {{report}} initially, an extra tab will be added: '{{Eval}} filters'. This enables you to filter the {{report}} for responses to one or more questions. Select the filters you wish to use and run the {{report}} again for a smaller set of {{eval}} responses. In the example above, you may wish to see the responses for people who felt the course did not meet their expectations, to try and establish why not.</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}138b.png" alt="{{Eval}}s {{report}} - question filters" /></p>

<p>The results in the tables will now be shown just for those people that said 'no' to the first question. </p>
