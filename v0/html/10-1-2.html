<h1>10.1.2    {{Referral}}s - attendance</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The attendance tab stores who was involved in the {{referral}} </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The attendance tab records details of everyone who was involved in the {{referral}}. As well as {{user}}s, this can include {{org}}s, {{staff}}, or others - anyone with a profile in the system. Initially you will see your name as a member of {{staff}} in the list: </p>

<p>To add additional {{people}}, start typing their name in the box. When you have typed at least three letters, a drop-down menu will appear showing all matches: select the name you are looking for. They will be added to the table. </p>

<p>To alter the attendance type or role for a particular person, click on the table cell and a drop-down box will appear. Select the appropriate option. Your system administrator can add options to these lists (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.0">18.2.0  System Administration - Lists</a>). </p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}194c.png" alt="Adding roles of {{referral}} {{people}}" /></p>

<p>In the case of {{referral}}s, there are additional roles that may be relevant and can be useful when running {{report}}s. These are: 'referrer' (who made the {{referral}}); 'Referred to' (the member of {{staff}} that's accepted the {{referral}}); and 'Service {{user}} referred' (the actual {{person}}that was referred). </p>

<p>There is also the option to add any further notes concerning the attendees. Click in the notes box along from their name to add further detail. To remove someone added in error, click the delete box - the right-hand table cell of the row you wish to delete. This will check and then remove them only from the table, not the database. Although it's unlikely to be relevant in {{referral}}s, you can also add the number of {{people}} that attended who are unknown to you: a large public event, for example. Just add the number of people in the final field 'Number of unknown attendees'. </p>
