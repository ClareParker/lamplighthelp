<h1>12.6.1    {{Comm}}s - adding your CampaignMonitor API details</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need to tell {{Lamplight}} about your CampaignMonitor account so the two systems can talk to each other, through the system admin menu </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you've set up your CampaignMonitor account, you'll need you API key. This is similar to (but not the same as) a username and password that one computer program uses to identify itself to another. There are instructions to find your CampaignMonitor API key <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/getting-started/"> on the CampaignMonitor site</a>: follow these to get the API key and Client ID. You then need to enter these into {{Lamplight}}: your system administrator will need to go to Admin -> system administration -> change global settings. On the {{Comm}}s module tab enter the API key and Client ID. These are both long and unpleasant strings of characters and numbers that you'll want to copy and paste from CampaignMonitor to {{Lamplight}}. Click 'save'.</p>

<p>{{Lamplight}} will now be able to start talking to CampaignMonitor to set up and send email campaigns. </p>
