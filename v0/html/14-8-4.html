<h1>14.8.4    Using {{group}} data views as a summary tab</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can add a summary tab to profiles which will bring information from the different tabs into one. Use a {{group}} data view to create a summary tab. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can add a summary tab to profiles which will bring information from the different tabs into one. This is fully customisable; each system operator can set up a different summary tab, and the summary tab uses a {{group}} data view to know what information to display. You can change or remove this at any time.</p>

<p>To add a summary tab:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a {{group}} data view with the information you want on the summary tab (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.1">14.8.1  Creating {{group}} data views</a>) </li>
<li>Go to {{Group}}s -> {{group}} data views -> view, on the main menu</li>
<li>Right-click or use the menu button, on the {{group}} data view you want to use. Click on 'use in summary tab in profiles' on the popup window. You will receive a confirmation message that the setting has changed.</li>
<li>View a profile for someone. You'll see a new 'summary' tab displayed as the first tab.</li>
</ul>

<p>To change the {{group}} data view you use, just repeat this with the relevant {{group}} data view. To remove the summary tab completely, click 'remove summary tab' on the summary tab itself within a profile. </p>
