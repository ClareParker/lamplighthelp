<blockquote>

<p>You will see the following screen, listing current operators and their details.</p>

<p>The context menu for this table allows you to add, edit or delete database operators. Right click on a row on the table to see the menu.</p>

<p>See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.6.1">18.6.1  System Administration - Adding a new database operator</a> for more help on creating database operators. If an operator forgets their password, they can request a new one from the login page. Alternatively, you can reset it for them here, and {{Lamplight}} will tell you the new password. </p>
