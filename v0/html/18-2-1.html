<h1>18.2.1    System Administration - {{Workarea}}s</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Current {{workarea}}s are shown in bold, with the {{subworkarea}}s listed below them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>{{Workarea}}s and {{subworkarea}}s are managed in a similar to other lists within the system administration menu (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.0">18.2.0  System Administration - Lists</a> ).:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}145a.png" alt="Editing {{workarea}}s and {{outcome}}s" /></p>

<p>Always create and type in your {{workarea}} heading initially, so that it appears in bold, before adding the {{subworkarea}}s below it. We would recommend that colours are added AFTER the headings have been entered. To colour co-ordinate your {{workarea}}s, double-click over <strong>Background colour</strong>, select the colour by moving the cursor around the colour pad, and click <strong>save changes</strong> to save. </p>
