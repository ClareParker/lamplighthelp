<h1>18.2.3    System Administration - relationships</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Relationship types can be added in the same way as all lists in {{Lamplight}}: see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.2.0">18.2.0  System Administration - Lists</a> for more. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Relationship types can be added via the list method. To add, edit or delete relationships go to admin -> system administration -> relation types between people </p>

<p>Double click to add a new relation type, press enter on your keyboard to save. You have the option to allow the relationship to be used in linked records: {{work}} records, {{outcome}}s, {{referral}} and {{comm}}s. The default option is set at no, double click over the word no if you wish to change it, press enter to save your choice. </p>

<p>If you do this, then {{people}} linked together by this relationship will appear in the 'search as you type' box when adding them to a {{work}} etc. record. The record will then appear on the profile of both {{people}} in the relationship. </p>
