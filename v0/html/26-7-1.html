<p>To transfer data from {{Lamplight}} into Sage, you will need an additional import utility called ImportPlus, which accepts spreadsheet files and inserts them into your copy of Sage. If you do not already have it, this is available from <a href="">SkyeWright</a> for a modest fee. </p>

<p>Full instructions are included with ImportPlus; in brief:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create the invoice in Lamplight (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.6.2">26.6.2  Creating invoices in bulk</a>).</li>
<li>Download the .csv spreadsheet file that is generated by {{Lamplight}}. Save it on your computer: we would suggest you create a directory for these files, and ensure you use sensible file names (including the date in them is probably a good idea).</li>
<li>Open up Sage and ImportPlus on your computer.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions in the ImportPlus wizard</li>
</ol>

<p>The invoice data is now available in Sage. You can now create invoices directly as you would normally. </p>
