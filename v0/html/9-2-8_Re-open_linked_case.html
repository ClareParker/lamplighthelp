<h1>9.2.8    Re-open {{linked case}}</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you do need to add a record to a closed {{linked case}}, you need to re- open it first. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To re-open a closed {{linked case}}, click 're open {{linked case}}' in the context menu. See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/13.6.0">13.6.0  Re-opening a closed {{linked case}}</a> for more about open and closed {{linked case}}s.</p>

<p>If a record is not linked to a {{linked case}}, or if the {{linked case}} is already open, you cannot re-open it, and the option will be disabled. </p>
