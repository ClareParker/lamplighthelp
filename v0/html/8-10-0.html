<h1>8.10.0    {{Group}}s tab</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The {{group}}s tab shows which {{group}}s a {{person}} belongs to. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tab shows the {{group}}s that the {{person}} is part of. (See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.0.0">14.0.0  Introduction to {{group}}s</a> for more on {{group}}s). </p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}51a.png" alt="{{Group}}s tab in a profile" /></p>

<p>The table shows the name of the {{group}}, the {{group}} description, how many people are in the {{group}} and what type of {{group}} it is (auto, manual or merge).</p>

<p>Right clicking or using the menu button on the table will give you a range of options:</p>

<ul>
<li>View full details - allows you to view the {{group}} using a {{group}} data view (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.0">14.8.0  {{Group}} data views</a> ). This will open in the main window.</li>
<li>Quick view in popup - lets you view the names of other members of the {{group}}.</li>
<li>Edit - will let you edit the {{group}} definition.</li>
<li>Delete - will delete the entire {{group}}.</li>
<li>{{Comm}} - takes you to the {{Comm}}s screen, with all members of the {{group}} listed as recipients of the {{comm}} (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/12.0.0">12.0.0  {{Comm}}s</a>). </li>
<li>Print - will open a new tab in your browser where you can print the profiles of all the members of the group</li>
</ul>

<p>{{Auto group}}s are based on a set of search criteria, and each time the {{group}} is used, {{Lamplight}} re-runs the search and updates the {{group}} membership. This is stored until the next time the {{group}} is used. However, when you view {{group}} membership on a profile tab, {{Lamplight}} uses the stored memberships - it does not re-check every {{group}} - it would take too long. This means that membership of {{auto group}}s is as of the last time the {{group}} was actually used. To refresh the membership of an {{auto group}}, you need to use the 'quick view in popup' or similar function to force the system to re-run the searches. </p>
