<p>Section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.2.1">26.2.1  Setting up charge rules - general points</a> explains the 'name' and 'previous rules' fields. </p>

<p>For each attendance type, you can set an amount or a percentage. If you set an amount (e.g. Â£50) then they will be charged that amount: this is not culmulative from previous rules. If you set a percentage (e.g. 75%), this will use an amount from a previous rule. If you use percentages, you probably don't want to use the rule first in the policy. You could do, but it will come out as 0 (as n% of 0 is 0). </p>

<p>You can mix and match fixed amounts and percentages for different attendance types. In general you are likely to want to combine both attendance roles and types: see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/26.2.5">26.2.5  Setting up or editing an attendance/role based charge rule</a> for how to do this. </p>

<p>When you are finished, click 'save' in the bottom-right hand corner. You will be taken back to the charging menu, and you'll see your new rule in the 'charge rules' section. </p>
