<h1>8.13.0    Deleted profiles</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deleted profiles are archived, and can be restored if needed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have deleted a profile, they are archived in the system. This means that they and the {{work}} you have done with them will be included in {{report}}s. These profiles can be re-instated from the archive. To do this you will need to add them as a new user, (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.4.0">8.4.0  Adding a profile</a>) and click on their name as it appears in the duplicate box. When their profile appears, click on the undelete button on their profile </p>
