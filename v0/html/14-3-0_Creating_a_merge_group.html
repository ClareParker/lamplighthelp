<h1>14.3.0    Creating a {{merge group}}</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>A {{merge group}} is a {{group}} which is created by combining the members of existing {{group}}s together. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>{{Merge group}} change as their component {{group}}s change, and remove any duplicates. They can be used in the same way that {{manual group}}s and {{auto group}}s are.</p>

<p>On the main menu go to {{Group}}s -> add -> add {{merge group}}s. Ensure that you have first given the {{group}} a name and description. </p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}183a.png" alt="Adding a {{merge group}}" /></p>

<p>On the '{{Group}}s' tab start typing the name of {{group}}s that you've already set up, and they will be added to the table. Continue until all have been added and click Save on the right hand side. </p>
