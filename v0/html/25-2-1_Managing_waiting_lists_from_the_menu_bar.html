<h1>25.2.1    Managing {{waiting list}}s from the menu bar</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>To view all {{waiting list}}s, on the main menu go to {{work}} -> view -> {{waiting list}}s. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A table will display all of the {{waiting list}}s that have been created, and their status.</p>

<p>With this table, as with others in {{Lamplight}}, if you have a number of {{waiting list}}s shown in the table you can show more rows in the table and if you have multiple pages you can change the page number. You can also sort the table by clicking on the column header.</p>

<p>Along from each {{waiting list}}, there is also a menu button, if it has been enabled within your personal settings, which allows further steps to be taken using the information of the specific {{waiting list}}. If you do not have a menu button, move the mouse over the {{waiting list}} name and right click - the same context menu will appear.</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}229a.png" alt="{{waiting list}} context menu" /></p>

<p>The first option on context menu is <strong>view full details.</strong> This shows you each {{person}} currently on the {{waiting list}}, the date they joined and the length of time they have been on the {{waiting list}}. If the view full details has a black arrow to the right, {{group}} data views have been created and this option provides the opportunity to use these with the members of the {{waiting list}}. See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.0">14.8.0  {{Group}} data views</a> for more information on {{group}} data views.</p>

<p>The second option on the context menu allows you to view the <strong>current members of the {{waiting list}} in a pop-up box</strong> that you can either download into a spreadsheet, print the table or close the box down.</p>

<p>The third option allows you to view an <strong>historical view</strong>, which shows the details of all past members, including those that have left the list as well as current members. Again this table can be re-organised, downloaded or printed if required.</p>

<p>If you have the appropriate access level the context menu will allow you to edit the {{waiting list}} or delete it. If you do not have the appropriate access level the option on the menu will appear as grey text and is not available to be selected.</p>

<p>If you have the {{comm}}s module enabled on your system, the context menu will also show a '{{comm}}' option. When selected this will move you directly into a new {{comm}}s record. Those on the {{waiting list}} (not including historical members) will have their names transferred directly into the recipients tab on the {{comm}} record. See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/12.0.0">12.0.0  {{Comm}}s</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The final option is the option to print. When selected a new tab in your browser will open so that you can print the information about the {{waiting list}} members. </p>
