<p>{{Report}}s in {{Lamplight}} show numerical summaries of the data held in the system. There is a great deal of flexibility in how you filter and present the information. There are some aspects of {{report}}s that are common to all (or most) {{report}}s, and some that are specific to different {{report}}s.</p>

<p>Please note that you need to have '{{staff}}', 'manager', 'admin' or 'reporter' access rights to view {{report}}s. </p>
