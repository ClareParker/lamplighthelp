<h1>13.1.0    Overview of {{linked case}}s</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>{{Linked case}}s link different kinds of record ({{work}}, {{outcome}}, {{comm}}s etc) together. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>{{Linked case}}s are a way of organising records within {{Lamplight}}. One person may have several {{linked case}}s; each {{linked case}} may involve several different people. There is a lot of flexibility so you can use them in the way that suits your way of working.</p>

<p>Different types of record can be linked together to form a single {{linked case}}. For example, one {{linked case}} may consist of 4 {{work}} records; some {{outcome}} measures; and a couple of {{comm}}s (if you have the {{comm}}s module). To link a particular record to a {{linked case}}, use the options on the right-click context menu.</p>

<p>{{Linked case}}s may be open or closed. You can only link records to open {{linked case}}s. </p>
