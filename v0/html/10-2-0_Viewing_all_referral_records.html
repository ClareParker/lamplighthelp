<h1>10.2.0    Viewing all {{referral}} records</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>To view all {{referral}} records, click '{{work}} -> view -> {{referral}}' on the main menu </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The {{referral}}s list shows additional information, including the referrer, and who the {{referral}} was made to.</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}196a.png" alt="Viewing {{referral}}s" /></p>

<p>This lists all {{referral}} records that have occurred in the last month, ordered by date with the most recent showing at the top. To restrict the listing to particular dates or {{workarea}}s, click the '+' icon on the right of the Search bar, and search options will appear. Change the details and click the 'fetch data' button and the table will reload. </p>

<p>The context menu for the table has a number of options: right-click on a row of the table to see these. Some will be disabled, depending on the {{referral}} record. The options on this context menu are very similar to those for {{work}} records: see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.2.0">9.2.0  Viewing all {{work}} records</a> for more information. </p>
