# 12.7.1    {{Comm}}s - adding your MailChimp API details

> You need to tell {{Lamplight}} about your MailChimp account so the two systems can talk to each other, through the system admin menu. 

Once you've set up your MailChimp account, you'll need you API key. This is similar to (but not the same as) a username and password that one computer program uses to identify itself to another. 

There are instructions to find your MailChimp API key [on the MailChimp site](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key): follow these to get the API key. 

You then need to enter these into {{Lamplight}}: your system administrator will need to go to Admin -> system administration -> change global settings. On the {{Comm}}s module tab enter the API key. This is a long and unpleasant strings of characters and numbers that you'll want to copy and paste from MailChimp to {{Lamplight}}. Click 'save'.

{{Lamplight}} will now be able to start talking to MailChimp to set up and send email newsletters.
