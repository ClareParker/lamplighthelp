# 24.4.0    Publishing {{work}} records to plings.net

> Plings.net (Places to go, things to do) is a website for young people listing activities near them. You can set up {{Lamplight}} to publish {{work}} records to Plings automatically. 

As well as, or instead of publishing to your website, you can publish records on plings.net, a website for young people. To do so you will need to contact plings directly to request an API key (like a password), and then {{Lamplight}} to enable plings publishing. Once you have done so, additional options will then appear on the publishing tab of a {{work}} record. Plings requests additional information about the record, and these are displayed on the publishing tab. You'll need to fill in all of these for the record to be published successfully

You will also need to tell plings about the locations at which your events happen in advance - your system administrator can do this in through the system admin -> manage locations section of {{Lamplight}}.
