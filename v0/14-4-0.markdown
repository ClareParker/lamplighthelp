# 14.4.0    Viewing {{group}}s

> To view all {{group}}s currently set up, click {{Group}}s -> View all in the main menu. You will see a table listing all {{group}}s, their descriptions, and other details: 

![List of all groups]({{imgpath}}105a.png)

Note that the {{group}} sizes are updated when the {{group}} is used, so for {{auto group}}s this figure may be inaccurate. If you need to be sure how many members a {{group}} has, view it's members (see section [14.5.0  Viewing {{group}} members](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.5.0)).
