# 12.6.1    {{Comm}}s - adding your CampaignMonitor API details

> You need to tell {{Lamplight}} about your CampaignMonitor account so the two systems can talk to each other, through the system admin menu 

Once you've set up your CampaignMonitor account, you'll need you API key. This is similar to (but not the same as) a username and password that one computer program uses to identify itself to another. There are instructions to find your CampaignMonitor API key [ on the CampaignMonitor site](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/getting-started/): follow these to get the API key and Client ID. You then need to enter these into {{Lamplight}}: your system administrator will need to go to Admin -> system administration -> change global settings. On the {{Comm}}s module tab enter the API key and Client ID. These are both long and unpleasant strings of characters and numbers that you'll want to copy and paste from CampaignMonitor to {{Lamplight}}. Click 'save'.

{{Lamplight}} will now be able to start talking to CampaignMonitor to set up and send email campaigns.
