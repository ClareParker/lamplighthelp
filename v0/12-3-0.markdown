# 12.3.0    Viewing all {{comm}} records

> To see all {{comm}}s sent or logged, click view -> all -> {{comm}}s on the main menu. 

{{Comm}}s are only stored if you have the {{comm}}s module enabled.

To view a list of all {{comm}}s records, click on '{{Work}} -> View -> {{Comm}}s' on the main menu. You will see the following screen:

![Viewing all {{comm}} records]({{imgpath}}90a.png)

This lists all {{comm}} records occurring in the last month, ordered by date with the most recent showing at the top.

To restrict the listing to particular dates or {{workarea}}s, click the '+' icon on the right of the Search bar, and search options will appear. Change the details and click the 'fetch data' button and the table will reload.

The context menu for the table has a number of options: right-click on a row of the table to see these. Some will be disabled, depending on the {{comm}} record. You cannot edit emails once they've been sent: because they've been sent.

The options on this context menu are very similar to those for {{work}} records: see section [9.2.0  Viewing all {{work}} records](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/9.2.0) for more information.
