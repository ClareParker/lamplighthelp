# 12.1.0    Creating a {{comm}}

> To create a {{comm}}, go to {{Work}}->{{Comm}}->create {{comm}} on the main menu. 

To create a {{comm}}, go to {{Work}} -> {{comm}} -> create on the main menu. You will see the main screen for creating {{comm}}s:

![Creating a {{comm}} - main menu]({{imgpath}}83a.png)

You will need to go through each tab to set the type of {{comm}}; the recipients; email details (if relevant); files to attach (if relevant) and the {{message}} itself.

When you have added all information, click the 'create/send' button in the bottom right. If you have the {{comm}}s module enabled the details of the {{comm}} will be saved to the {{people}} it was sent to.
