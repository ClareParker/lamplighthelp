# 14.7.0    My {{group}}s

> {{Group}}s you have created, or edited most recently, will be tagged as belonging to you. These provide a short-cut in the main menu: on {{Group}}s-> My {{group}}s-> and you will see a list of these {{group}}s. 

Clicking on the name of the {{group}} will show you the simple list of members. 

If you just click on {{Group}}s -> My {{group}}s on the main menu you will see the list of your {{group}}s in a table, similar to section [14.4.0  Viewing {{group}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.4.0) .
