# 12.6.2    {{Comm}}s - creating a CampaignMonitor mailing list from {{Lamplight}}

> You can use {{group}}s in {{Lamplight}} to set up 'mailing lists' in CampaignMonitor. Set up (or use an existing {{group}}) first, and then use the context menu to synchronise with CampaignMonitor. 

You'll need a {{group}} as the basis of your CampaignMonitor mailing list: see section [14.0.0  Introduction to {{group}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.0.0) for more on {{group}}s. When you are ready, go to {{group}}s -> view all on the main menu and find the {{group}} you want to use. When you open the context menu (right-click on click the menu button), hover your mouse over the '{{Comm}}' option and you'll see some CampaignMonitor options:

![{{Group}}s context menu - campaign monitor options]({{imgpath}}237a.png)

If this is the first time you are doing this, you'll need to 'Create CampaignMonitor list' first. You'll receive a confirmation message if this was successfuly.

Once the list has been created, you need to tell CampaignMonitor who is on it. Again, open the context menu for the {{group}}, hover over '{{Comm}}' and select 'Synchronise Campaign Monitor List'. {{Lamplight}} will now transfer all the email addresses for everyone in the {{group}} to CampaignMonitor. From now one, when you update the {{group}} this synchronisation should happen automatically, but you can also do so again manually to be certain. Depending on the size of the {{group}}, this may take a few minutes. CampaignMonitor imposes limits on how much information you can send it at once, so {{Lamplight}} has to do the synchronisation in batches. You can log in to CampaignMonitor to check on progress. Bear in mind though that anyone with missing or invalid email addresses, or who has 'send email' set to 'No', will not be transferred, so the size of your {{group}} in {{Lamplight}} may be larger than the mailing list in CampaignMonitor. 

You are now ready to start setting up your email campaign.

If for any reason you want to remove the mailing list from CampaignMonitor you can do so from this context menu. Doing so will not affect the {{group}} in {{Lamplight}}.
