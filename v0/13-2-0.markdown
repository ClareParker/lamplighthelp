# 13.2.0    Opening a new {{linked case}}

> Each {{linked case}} is identified by name - just enter a new name to start a new {{linked case}}. 

If you wish to start a new {{linked case}}, simply type the name of the new {{linked case}} into the '{{linked case}}s' popup window

![Starting a new {{linked case}}]({{imgpath}}95a.png)

Matches will be displayed in a drop-down as you type, and you can either select one of these to use the existing {{linked case}}, or ignore them to create a new one. To create the link (and if you are adding a new {{linked case}}, to save the {{linked case}} details), click the 'save' button in the bottom right of the popup window. The main listing of {{work}} records will be refreshed, showing the link to the {{linked case}} that's just been added. Once you have created a new {{linked case}}, this will appear in the drop-down when you come to add more records to the {{linked case}}.

In a profile, you can also drag one record onto another to create a link.
