# 14.3.0    Creating a {{merge group}}

> A {{merge group}} is a {{group}} which is created by combining the members of existing {{group}}s together. 

{{Merge group}} change as their component {{group}}s change, and remove any duplicates. They can be used in the same way that {{manual group}}s and {{auto group}}s are.

On the main menu go to {{Report}}s -> {{group}} -> add -> add {{merge group}}. Ensure that you have first given the {{group}} a name and description.

On the '{{Group}}s' tab start typing the name of {{group}}s that you've already set up, and they will be added to the table. Continue until all have been added and click Save on the right hand side.
