# 4.1.0    Menu Bar

> The menu is the main way that you will navigate around the system. 

The menu bar along the top of the screen is where you will navigate around the system. 

The first line of menu items (starting with 'Home') can be clicked; clicking displays the menu for that section. If you hover the mouse over any heading a dropdown sub-menu may appear. Simply click on the sub-menu item to go to the page you need.

Some menus have sub-menus: you can tell because there are small black arrows pointing to the right.

Clicking on the menu headings themselves will take you to the first item on the menu. So, if you click on **{{People}}** it will take you to the view all {{user}}s page.

Throughout this manual you will see 'go to {{report}} -> {{outcome}} {{report}} on the main menu'. The arrow indicates the {{report}} sub-menu.
