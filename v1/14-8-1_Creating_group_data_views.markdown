# 14.8.1    Creating {{group}} data views

> Any {{group}} data view may be used with any {{group}}. To set up a new {{group}} data view, go to {{report}} -> {{group}}s->{{Group}} data views->Add on the main menu. 

When you enter the new {{group}} data view screen, you will see the screen below:

![Adding a {{group}} data view]({{imgpath}}576a.png)

**View name tab: **you will first need to give the view a name and description. The name is what you will see mostly, so try and choose something that you will remember what it's for in the future. Both the name and description are required fields.

**Contact details tab:** select which contact fields you'd like to see.

**{{User}} fields, {{Funder}} fields and {{Contact}} tabs:** will let you add some of the fields from the tabs your people/organisation use in profiles. 

**{{Outcome}}s, {{Eval}}s, {{Linked case}}s tabs:** lets you add summary details about outcomes, {{eval}}s and {{linked case}}s (if you have those modules enabled).

**Blank column(s)** means you can add blank columns to your {{group}} data views, perhaps useful if you are using {{group}} data views for a register and you need a 'signed' column.

Simply select the information you require.

When you have added all the information you wish to see, click the 'save' button in the bottom-right.
