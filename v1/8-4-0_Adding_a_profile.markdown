# 8.4.0    Adding a profile

> To add a new profile for a {{person}}, click '{{people}}, choose the type, hover over it and click 'add new' on the main menu. 

To add a new profile move your mouse up to the menu bar to the {{People}} option, hover over {{user}} and select add from the sub menu that appears.

You will then see a page on which to add the basic information about that individual or organisation.

All profiles, whether they are for {{user}}s, {{org}}s or {{contact}}s start from the same initial input page. Enter the organisation name and click the Save button on the right.

{{Lamplight}} will check for duplicates, and warn you if it finds any:

![Duplicates found]({{imgpath}}511d.png)

If you see this screen, you will need to decide if the organisation you're adding is actually a duplicate, or if you really need to add it. If it's already on the system, click the row of the table for the organisation you want to use. If not, there is a button to add a new one at the bottom of the popup window.

You will now see the profile page for the {{person}} you have just entered (or the organisation you selected in the duplicate checking process). See section [8.3.0  Profiles](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.3.0) for more information about profiles.

Along from their name is a series of buttons; print, del and edit

  * Print: will open up a new tab in your web browser with their profile information for you to choose which tabs of information you wish to print.
  * Delete: will delete their profile from view, and archive it so it will not appear in day to day use (but can be retrieved if needed).
  * Edit: will open up a form so that you can edit the name and type of profile.
