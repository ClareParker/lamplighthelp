# 17.1.1    {{Report}} filters

> All {{report}}s let you filter by date, {{workarea}} and {{group}}. Other filters are available depending on the {{report}}. 

All {{report}}s have the same set of filters initially, shown below:

![{{Report}} filters]({{imgpath}}592a.png)

The date from and date to fields will show records dated between these two dates, including the dates selected.

The {{workarea}} button allows you to filter for particular {{workarea}}s, or {{subworkarea}}s.

The locations button allow you to filter by where the activity took place 

The {{group}} filter lets you use {{group}}s (see section [14.0.0  Introduction to {{group}}s](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.0.0)) to restrict the {{report}} to a particular set of {{people}}. The {{report}} will show data for the members of the {{group}}, but does not apply the filters for the {{group}} to the {{report}}.

For example, you may create a {{group}} of everyone with low 'income' dial scores, giving you a list of {{people}}. You can now use this {{group}} as a filter to see the {{eval}} results for those {{people}}.

The Type of support, Role and Profile types options can for the most part be ignored in VIP Online.
