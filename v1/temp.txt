<p>To view a {{report}} of your campaign responses, view all campaigns (see section {{sect673}}), right-click (or use the menu button) on the campaign you wish to view, and select 'view {{report}} of responses'</p>

<p>This will take you directly to the {{Eval}}s {{report}}, set the dates and other details from your campaign dates, and show you the results.</p>

<p>From there you can carry out further analysis (see section {{sect603}} for more help on {{eval}} {{report}}s) and download the results (see section {{sect595}}). </p>
