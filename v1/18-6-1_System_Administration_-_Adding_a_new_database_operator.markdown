# 18.6.1    System Administration - Adding a new database operator

> To add a new operator, follow the instructions in section [18.6.0  System Administration - Database operators](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.6.0) and select 'Add new' on the context menu for the table. 

A popup window will open requesting their basic details:

![new database operator]({{imgpath}}615a.png)

Further details about operator roles can be seen in section [18.6.2  System Administration - operator permission levels](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.6.2). If the **Copy my display settings?** box is ticked, the new operator will have the same set-up as chosen by you in your 'Change my personal settings' section [18.12.0  My personal settings - customising {{Lamplight}}](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.12.0). When you click 'save' to create the new operator, they will be emailed their new password and login details. The system will also create a profile for that person, setting them as a member of {{staff}}. To view this profile click 'View file' on the context menu. See section [8.3.0  Profiles](/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.3.0) for more about profiles.
