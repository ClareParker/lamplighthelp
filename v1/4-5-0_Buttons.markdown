# 4.5.0    Buttons

> Buttons do more than click - some have menus too. 

Many screens have buttons that do particular things: usually adding or editing information, or saving it. Just click the button, normally located on the bottom right hand side.

Some buttons, mainly for selecting {{workarea}}s, do more. When you select something from one of these buttons, you will see the text on the button change to whatever it is you've just selected.

You can often also make multiple selections on these buttons. With {{workarea}}s, select a {{subworkarea}} and you will see the {{workarea}} and {{subworkarea}} on the button. You can now select another {{subworkarea}} (from the same {{workarea}}) and it will be added again:
