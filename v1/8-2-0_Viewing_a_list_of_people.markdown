# 8.2.0    Viewing a list of {{people}}

> Use the '{{people}}' menu to view lists of all {{people}}. 

To view a list of all {{user}}s, click the '{{people}}' on the main menu:

![{{People}} icon on the menu]({{imgpath}}509a.png)

A table will list all {{user}}s on the system. The right-click context menu will let you go to someone's profile, or carry out other actions as needed.

You can use the paginator to jump through the pages of {{people}} ({{Lamplight}} shows 10 per page by default), and you can sort the table by clicking on the blue column headers.

To view sectors or external agencies, click on the main menu in the same way.
