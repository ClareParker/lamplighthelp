<h1>18.12.0    My personal settings - customising {{Lamplight}}</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each database operator has the ability to customise aspects of {{Lamplight}} to their preference. The changes they make will not affect anyone else. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go to admin -> system administration -> change my personal settings. Please note that you are unlikely to need to change any of these settings in the normal course of using VIP Online.</p>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
<li>enter in your 'signature' - the text that is added automatically to the bottom of {{comm}}s. </li>
<li>decide what tabs appear on your homepage. These can also be re-arranged by click, holding and dragging the boxes into the order you wish them to appear. </li>
<li>choose which {{project}} would be the one you first arrive to when you log in (if you have a multi-{{project}} system)</li>
<li>decide if you wish to use a {{group}} data view as a summary tab. For more information please see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.1">14.8.1  Creating {{group}} data views</a> </li>
<li>change the database colour scheme. We strongly recommend you keep the VIP Online colour scheme.</li>
<li>show or hide menu options</li>
<li>choose your preferred view of {{outcome}}s data on the {{outcome}} profile tab</li>
<li>decide the most suitable minute precision used in records - do you need to-the-minute accuracy, or will 15 minutes do?</li>
</ul>

<p>Once changes have been made, click 'Save' in the bottom right hand corner. To fully refresh and update the system of your changes, click F5 on you keyboard. </p>
