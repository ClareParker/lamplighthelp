<p>{{Group}} data views are a way of selecting the information you wish to view about {{people}}. For example, you may wish to be able to view phone numbers and the date each member of a {{group}} last attended. It is a way of adding columns to the table when viewing members of a {{group}} (and saving this): they do not filter the information in any way.</p>

<p>It is best not to create one {{group}} data view that has everything in it: it will be harder to view, because the information won't fit on a screen, and it will take longer for {{Lamplight}} to show the data. It will be better to create a number of {{group}} data views for different purposes.</p>

<p>To use the {{group}} data views you have created, see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.2">14.8.2  View {{group}} members using {{group}} data views</a> . </p>
