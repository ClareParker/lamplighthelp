</blockquote>

<p>To view {{eval}}s entered, go to {{Work}}-> View all-> {{Eval}}s on the main menu. A list of completed {{eval}}s will be shown. This screen is very similar to viewing {{work}} records or {{outcome}}s: see section {{sect}} for more information.</p>

<p>If you have added {{people}} in the 'attendance' tab while entering the {{eval}} answers, you can also view the {{eval}}s they have completed in the '{{eval}}s' tab on their profile. </p>
