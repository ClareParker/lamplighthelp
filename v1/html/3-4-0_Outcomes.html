<h1>3.4.0    {{Outcome}}s</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>{{Outcome}}s in {{Lamplight}} measure the change over time you see in the {{people}} you {{work}} with. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>{{Outcome}}s are the impact your {{work}} has on individuals or organisations, the changes over time that they or you observe. The core {{Lamplight}} system enables you to take a series of 'snapshots' at different times, and see how those snapshots change as time goes by.</p>

<p>For example, your organisation may be working to improve the self-confidence of the people you {{work}} with. In January you would measure how confident John felt on a scale of 1-10 and enter it into {{Lamplight}}. A couple of months later, you measure John again. Then three months later still, you ask John again how confident he feels. In five months you have seen an improvement in John's confidence.</p>

<p>{{Lamplight}} lets you follow what happens to individuals (in their profiles), but also to see the overall impact for everyone you are working with (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.3.0">17.3.0  {{Outcome}}s {{report}}</a> for more about {{outcome}} {{report}}s).</p>

<p>This kind of data, where you follow what happens to particular individuals over a period of time, is called 'panel data'. The other way of assessing impact is by surveying a sample of people every now and again - for example, sending out an anonymous questionnaires to 10% of your {{user}}s every 6 months. This is known as 'latitudinal data'. The {{Lamplight}} {{eval}}s module (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/15.0.0">15.0.0  {{Eval}}s module overview</a> for more about {{eval}}s) enables you to handle this different type of data. </p>
