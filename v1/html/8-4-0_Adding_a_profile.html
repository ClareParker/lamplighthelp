<h1>8.4.0    Adding a profile</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>To add a new profile for a {{person}}, click '{{people}}, choose the type, hover over it and click 'add new' on the main menu. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To add a new profile move your mouse up to the menu bar to the {{People}} option, hover over {{user}} and select add from the sub menu that appears.</p>

<p>You will then see a page on which to add the basic information about that individual or organisation.</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}511b.png" alt="Adding a new {{person}}" /></p>

<p>All profiles, whether they are for {{user}}s, {{org}}s or {{contact}}s start from the same initial input page. Enter the organisation name and click the Save button on the right.</p>

<p>{{Lamplight}} will check for duplicates, and warn you if it finds any:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}511d.png" alt="Duplicates found" /></p>

<p>If you see this screen, you will need to decide if the organisation you're adding is actually a duplicate, or if you really need to add it. If it's already on the system, click the row of the table for the organisation you want to use. If not, there is a button to add a new one at the bottom of the popup window.</p>

<p>You will now see the profile page for the {{person}} you have just entered (or the organisation you selected in the duplicate checking process). See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.3.0">8.3.0  Profiles</a> for more information about profiles.</p>

<p>Along from their name is a series of buttons; print, del and edit</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}511c.png" alt="The newly added profile" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Print: will open up a new tab in your web browser with their profile information for you to choose which tabs of information you wish to print.</li>
<li>Delete: will delete their profile from view, and archive it so it will not appear in day to day use (but can be retrieved if needed).</li>
<li>Edit: will open up a form so that you can edit the name and type of profile. </li>
</ul>
