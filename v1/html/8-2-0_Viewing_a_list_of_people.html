<h1>8.2.0    Viewing a list of {{people}}</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use the '{{people}}' menu to view lists of all {{people}}. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To view a list of all {{user}}s, click the '{{people}}' on the main menu:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}509a.png" alt="{{People}} icon on the menu" /></p>

<p>A table will list all {{user}}s on the system. The right-click context menu will let you go to someone's profile, or carry out other actions as needed.</p>

<p>You can use the paginator to jump through the pages of {{people}} ({{Lamplight}} shows 10 per page by default), and you can sort the table by clicking on the blue column headers.</p>

<p>To view sectors or external agencies, click on the main menu in the same way. </p>
