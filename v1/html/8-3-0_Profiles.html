<h1>8.3.0    Profiles</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every {{person}} has a profile, showing all information about that {{person}} </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Profiles are created for all of the individuals, families or organisations that you store on the database. These might be your {{user}}s, {{staff}}, {{contact}}s, {{funder}}s or other {{org}}s you need to store.</p>

<p>A profile is made up of a series of tabs containing the information you want to store about these {{people}}. You can store different information about the different kinds of {{people}} on the database. So, you can store one set of information for {{user}}s and a different set of information for {{funder}}s or your {{staff}}. For example, you might see presenting needs and medical history for your {{user}}s; CRB information for {{staff}}; and information about application deadlines and criteria for {{funder}}s.</p>

<p>All profiles have a contact information and relationship tabs but any additional tabs will be specified by your organisation. For more information about how to add these tabs see section {{sect}} . </p>
