<h1>3.5.0    {{Group}}s</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>{{Group}}s in {{Lamplight}} are collections of people and/or organisations. There are various ways of setting them up, and once you've done so, provide a number of powerful additional features to {{Lamplight}}. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>{{Group}}s are collections of {{people}}. Each {{person}} can belong to any number of {{group}}s.</p>

<p>You can use {{group}}s to:</p>

<ul>
<li>develop complex, custom searches</li>
<li>speed up data entry - instead of entering each person individually into a new {{work}} record, just type in the {{group}} name and they'll all be added (see section {{sect}} )</li>
<li>communicate - you can create mail merges for all the members of a {{group}} (see section {{sect}} )</li>
<li>{{report}} - groups can be used as filters in {{report}}s, so you can focus in your {{report}}ing when you need to (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/17.1.1">17.1.1  {{Report}} filters</a> )</li>
<li>summarize data - {{group}} data views lets you see any combination of data for the members of a {{group}} (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.8.0">14.8.0  {{Group}} data views</a> ).</li>
</ul>

<p>See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.0.0">14.0.0  Introduction to {{group}}s</a> for more on creating and using {{group}}s. </p>
