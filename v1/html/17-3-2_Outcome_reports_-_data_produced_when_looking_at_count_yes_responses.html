<h1>17.3.2    {{Outcome}} {{report}}s - data produced when looking at 'count yes responses'</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Counting number of yes responses' does just that - it doesn't look for change, just the number of 'yes' {{outcome}}s achieved. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In {{outcome}}s {{report}}s, you can select 'Count number of yes responses' in the 'How to summarise the data', and you will see a different table. This will not be relevant unless you have set up your own 'yes-no' {{outcome}} measures. </p>
