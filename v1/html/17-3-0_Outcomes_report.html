<p>The {{outcome}}s {{report}} summarises the changes over time recorded in the {{outcome}}s tab. The options available in the {{report}} presentation tab are:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}597a.png" alt="{{Outcome}}s {{report}} - presentation" /></p>

<p>There are different ways to summarise {{outcome}} data. By default, it works by looking at each {{person}}, and for each {{outcome}} calculating the difference between the latest and earliest {{outcome}}s recorded. It then calculates an average and other summary data for everyone. This means that only {{people}} with at least two {{outcome}}s recorded within the dates specified will be included in the {{report}}, so that the system can calculate a difference. </p>

<p>You can also look just at 'yes-no' {{outcome}}s and count up the number of 'yes' responses. This will be useful if the {{outcome}} is something achieved, and you are interested in the number of times it has been achieved (for example, 'Invited to job interview'). </p>

<p>The 'snapshot' option just looks at the values, not the change in them. This will give you a picture of 'where people are', but not what change has been achieved. </p>

<p>The scores for Yes-no outcomes are treated as no = 0 and yes = 1. </p>
