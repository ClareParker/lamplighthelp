<p>Further details about operator roles can be seen in section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.6.2">18.6.2  System Administration - operator permission levels</a>. If the <strong>Copy my display settings?</strong> box is ticked, the new operator will have the same set-up as chosen by you in your 'Change my personal settings' section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/18.12.0">18.12.0  My personal settings - customising {{Lamplight}}</a>. When you click 'save' to create the new operator, they will be emailed their new password and login details. The system will also create a profile for that person, setting them as a member of {{staff}}. To view this profile click 'View file' on the context menu. See section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/8.3.0">8.3.0  Profiles</a> for more about profiles. </p>
