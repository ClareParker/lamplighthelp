<p>The 'when and where' and 'attendance' tabs are the same as those for {{work}} records and {{outcome}}s (see section {{sect}} and {{sect}} or more details). {{Eval}}s can be anonymous: you do not need to have anyone listed in the attendance tab. However, if you do, you will be able to view the {{eval}} results in that user's profile, and when running {{report}}s you can use the fields in their profiles.</p>

<p>The third tab will be title of your {{eval}}. When you click on this, you will see the questions for this {{eval}}:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}582b.png" alt="Adding an {{eval}} - questions" /></p>

<p>Complete the answers to the questions, and click the 'save' button in the bottom right. You will now see the saved {{eval}}. </p>
