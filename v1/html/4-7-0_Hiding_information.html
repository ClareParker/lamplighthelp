<h1>4.7.0    Hiding information</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some things are hidden on screen until you need them: click the + sign to show them </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes information is hidden until you need it, to leave room on the screen. Instead, you will see a bar with a label, and a small '+' icon on the right. Just click the '+' icon to view the hidden information.</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}492a.png" alt="A hidden search bar" /> <img src="{{imgpath}}492b.png" alt="A revealed search bar" /></p>

<p>This happens when you are viewing lists of records, or with text editors. </p>
