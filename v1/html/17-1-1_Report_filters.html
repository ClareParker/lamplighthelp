<h1>17.1.1    {{Report}} filters</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>All {{report}}s let you filter by date, {{workarea}} and {{group}}. Other filters are available depending on the {{report}}. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>All {{report}}s have the same set of filters initially, shown below:</p>

<p><img src="{{imgpath}}592a.png" alt="{{Report}} filters" /></p>

<p>The date from and date to fields will show records dated between these two dates, including the dates selected.</p>

<p>The {{workarea}} button allows you to filter for particular {{workarea}}s, or {{subworkarea}}s.</p>

<p>The locations button allow you to filter by where the activity took place </p>

<p>The {{group}} filter lets you use {{group}}s (see section <a href="/help/index/v/{{version}}/p/14.0.0">14.0.0  Introduction to {{group}}s</a>) to restrict the {{report}} to a particular set of {{people}}. The {{report}} will show data for the members of the {{group}}, but does not apply the filters for the {{group}} to the {{report}}.</p>

<p>For example, you may create a {{group}} of everyone with low 'income' dial scores, giving you a list of {{people}}. You can now use this {{group}} as a filter to see the {{eval}} results for those {{people}}.</p>

<p>The Type of support, Role and Profile types options can for the most part be ignored in VIP Online. </p>
